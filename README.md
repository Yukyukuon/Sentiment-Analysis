# <b>Aspect-Term Polarity Classification in Sentiment Analysis</b>
## Introduction
This work implement a model that predicts opinion polarities (positive, negative or neutral) for given aspect terms in sentences. 
The model takes as input 3 elements: a sentence, a term occurring in the sentence, and its aspect category.For each input triple, it produces a polarity label: positive, negative or neutral. 
Note: the term can occur more than once in the same sentence, that is why its character start/end offsets are also provided.
